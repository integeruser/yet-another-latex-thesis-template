\chapter{Acknowledgements}
This work concludes a long and at times difficult journey.

I express my deep gratitude to my supervisors, Nicolas Couffin, for his guidance and knowledge, and Stefano Calzavara, for his patience and valuable comments. My thanks extend to Quarkslab for a challenging internship in an office full of brilliant and pleasant colleagues.

To the old and new friends I met at Ca' Foscari, I am truly grateful for the many \enquote{intelligent} and meaningful conversations, countless moments of plain fun, and unforgettable days and nights of hacking (and pizza) with \emph{c00kies@venice}.

For their love, understanding, and financial support, I give my heartfelt thanks to my parents, Michele and Emilia.
